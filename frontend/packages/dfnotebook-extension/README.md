# @dfnotebook/dfnotebook-extension

An extension for JupyterLab which provides an entry point, commands, and keyboard shortcuts for the [@dfnotebook/dfnotebook](../dfnotebook) package. This is a modification of the original [@jupyterlab/notebook-extension](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/packages/notebook-extension).

**Important:** Currently, you must **uninstall** the original, core notebook-extension to use dfnotebook-extension.

```bash
jupyter labextension uninstall @jupyterlab/notebook-extension
```
