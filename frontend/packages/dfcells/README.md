# @dfnotebook/dfcells

A JupyterLab package which provides a modified implementation of [@jupyterlab/cells](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/packages/cells), a Jupyter notebook cell.
These cells are used in the [@dfnotebook/dfnotebook](../dfnotebook).
The result of cell execution is shown in an output area, which is implemented in [@dfnotebook/dfoutputarea](../dfoutputarea).
Markdown and raw cells can have attachments, which is implemented in [@jupyterlab/attachments](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/packages/attachments).
