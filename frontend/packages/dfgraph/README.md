# @dfnotebook/dfgraph

A Dataflow Notebook package which provides the dfgraph interface and the visualization suite that goes along with it.

This is used by the main project for maintaining a client side view of the underlying graph structure. The cells are referenced by their UUIDs and contain information about the variables inside.
